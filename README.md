# Big Data Modelling and Management - Projects 1 and 2

Project 1: The Beer Project
Graph databases are a natural way of navigating distinct types of data. For this first project we took a graph database to analyze beer and breweries, exploring the database via python neo4j connector, loading the database using Docker.

Project 2: The World Wide Importers (WWI)
The focus of this assignment was modelling. We used the World Wide Importers database and converted it to a document-based database. To that end, we would be leveraging concepts like data denormalization, indices, and MongoDB design patterns, merging all the company data into a single and coherent Mongo database.
It was expected that, with our solution, WWI could have a better understanding of their business and that the different departments would be able to obtain efficiently the answers they need.
